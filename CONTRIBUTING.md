# Getting set up to work on Glide Data Grid

### Setting Up Codespaces

If you'd like to set up glide data grid locally and contribute, the easiest way to get up and running
is to use Codespaces if you have access to it. If you do not, simply cloning the repo and running `npm install` also works!

#### Steps

-   Cick the green dropdown labeled code, there should be two tabs: local and codespaces.
-   Click on codespaces.
-   If this is your first time, then create a new codespace. It will open a new browser tab and build the docker container for it - there will be a button to open the environment in VSCode if you'd prefer to run it that way
-   You should see a screen that says `Setting up your codespace` As soon as that's done, you should see a VSCode like UI with files on the left.

Once codespaces is up and runnng:

```bash
npm run i && npm run storybook
```

## Forking the data grid?

Please consider submitting your work for review. We are a small project but we are super enthused when anyone comes by to help us build the best damned data grid on the internet.
